## üìä Understanding Your Data

### Complaint Categories

- **Interpersonal Interactions**: Feeling disrespected, ignored, or treated unfairly by others
- **Delays & Timeliness**: Frustration with waiting in traffic, lines, or for responses
- **Quality & Reliability**: Poorly made products, services falling short of expectations
- **Pricing & Value**: Cost issues or feeling time/effort isn't adequately respected
- **Communication Issues**: Misunderstandings, unclear instructions, lack of updates
- **Process & Accessibility**: Complicated systems or inaccessible services
- **Emotional & Relational Dynamics**: Unmet expectations, lack of support in relationships

### Excuse Categories

- **Externalizing Blame**: Attributing failures solely to external circumstances or other people
- **Past Trauma Emphasis**: Citing previous negative experiences as reasons for current difficulties
- **Perceived Lack of Control**: Believing you're powerless to influence outcomes
- **Avoidance of Accountability**: Evading personal responsibility by shifting blame

## üß† The Philosophy

### What is a Complaint?

Describing an event or person negatively without indicating next steps to fix the problem. If you state a problem and then propose a solution immediately, it becomes a constructive observation rather than a complaint.

### What is an Excuse?

A justification that shifts responsibility away from yourself to explain a failure or inability to meet an obligation. An excuse removes your agency by placing the cause externally rather than acknowledging your choices.
